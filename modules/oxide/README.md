# HugeRTE Oxide skin tools
This project contains the default skins as well as tools and files needed to build your own skin for HugeRTE.

Visit the [TinyMCE 6 documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/creating-a-skin/) for instructions on how to create and build skins for HugeRTE until we host the docs on our own website.

## Building the skins
The build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
2. To view the skins, run `npm start` in this repository and see the oxide-test-data repository for more information.
