# Description
Acid implements the user interface for the HugeRTE color picker. It also exposes some modules to assist with colour calculations.

Like all modules in this monorepo (except for the hugerte module), this module is not considered public API and it may be changed at any time, no matter the corresponding HugeRTE version.
